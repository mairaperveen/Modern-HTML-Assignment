    <h1>Features of HTML5</h1>
    <p>
    <h3>New Doctype</h3>HTML5 uses &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; as the doctype declaration, making it simpler and more
    consistent compared to previous versions.</p>

    <p>
    <h3>Semantic Elements:</h3> HTML5 introduces new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;,
    &lt;article&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, and &lt;aside&gt;.
    These elements provide a better structure and meaning to the content, making it more accessible and understandable
    for both developers and assistive technologies.</p>

    <p><h3>Audio and Video Support:</h3>HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content without the
    need for third-party plugins.
    The &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements allow seamless integration of multimedia elements into web pages.</p>

    <p><h3>Canvas:</h3>HTML5 introduced the &lt;canvas&gt; element, which allows dynamic rendering of graphics, charts,
    animations,and other visualizations directly within the browser using JavaScript.</p>

    <p><h3>Form Enhancements:</h3>HTML5 introduced new input types such as date, email, url, and number, along with attributes like required and pattern, making form validation easier and more robust.</p>

    <p><h3>Offline Web Applications:</h3> HTML5 provides features like the Application Cache and Web Storage (localStorage and
        sessionStorage) that enable web applications to work offline and store data locally, enhancing the user
        experience.

    <p><h3>Web Workers:</h3>HTML5 allows the use of web workers, which are scripts that run in the background independently of the web page.This feature enables multithreaded processing, improving performance for complex web applications.</p>

    <p><h3>Geolocation: </h3>HTML5 enables websites to access the user's geographical location through the Geolocation API, allowing the
        development of location-based applications and services.</p>

    <p><h3>Responsive Design:</h3>HTML5 introduced features like media queries and viewport settings, enabling developers to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, improving the user experience on smartphones, tablets,
    and desktops.</p>
