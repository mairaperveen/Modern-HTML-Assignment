    <h1>HTML Entities</h1>
    <p>HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meaning in HTML, such as angle brackets (< and >), ampersands (&), and special characters like copyright symbols (Â©) or non-breaking spaces. These entities are used to display these characters correctly in web browsers.</p>
    <p>Here are five commonly used HTML entities:
<ol>
    <li>&lt; - Represents the less-than sign (<). Used to display the less-than symbol without starting an HTML tag.</li>
    <li>&gt; - Represents the greater-than sign (>). Used to display the greater-than symbol without ending an HTML tag.</li>
    <li>&amp; - Represents the ampersand symbol (&). Used to display the ampersand without starting an HTML entity.</li>
    <li>&quot; - Represents the double quote ("). Used to display double quotes inside HTML attributes that are enclosed within double quotes.</li>
    <li>&nbsp; - Represents a non-breaking space. Used to create a space that will not be collapsed in the HTML rendering, ensuring that words or characters separated by this entity will not be broken across lines.</li>
</ol>
     <p>These entities are essential for displaying special characters and symbols correctly in HTML documents. They help prevent conflicts with HTML syntax and ensure that the content is rendered as intended in web browsers.</p>
