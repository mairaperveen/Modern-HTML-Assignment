    <h2>1. Semantic Elements</h2>
    <p>HTML5 introduced new semantic elements like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;section&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;, providing a better structure for web documents. Semantic elements enhance accessibility and help search engines understand the content's meaning.</p>

    <h2>2. Audio and Video Support</h2>
    <p>HTML5 includes native support for audio and video elements (&lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt;), allowing seamless integration of multimedia content without relying on third-party plugins like Flash. This simplifies multimedia embedding and improves cross-browser compatibility.</p>

<section class="feature">
    <h2>3. Offline Web Applications</h2>
